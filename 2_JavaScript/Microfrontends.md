# Micro-frontends
- The idea behind [Micro Frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams. 
- Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. 
- A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface.
